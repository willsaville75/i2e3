# Indy Client-Side Refactoring

## Overview

We successfully refactored the Indy system to properly separate client and server concerns. The main issue was that `runIndyAction` was trying to execute server-side AI agents directly in the browser, which failed because the OpenAI API key is only available on the server.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (❌ Incorrect)
```
Browser → runIndyAction → runAgent → OpenAI API (FAILS - no API key)
```

### After (✅ Correct)
```
Browser → runIndyAction → HTTP POST → API Server → runAgent → OpenAI API
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Refactored `runIndyAction` (src/indy/runIndyAction.ts)

**Before:** Server-side function that directly called AI agents
```typescript
const result = await runAgent('createAgent', JSON.stringify({...}));
```

**After:** Client-side function that makes HTTP requests
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/indy/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ userInput, blockType, ... })
});
```

### 2. Added `applyIndyAction` Helper

New function to apply actions to the blocks store after successful API calls:
```typescript
export function applyIndyAction(
  action: IndyAction,
  store: BlockStore
): boolean
```

### 3. Updated IndyChatPanel

Changed from direct agent execution to API calls:
```typescript
// Before
const action = await runIndyAction(message, currentBlock, blockType);

// After  
const result = await runIndyAction(message, blockType, context);
if (result.success && result.action) {
  applyIndyAction(result.action, store);
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Security**: OpenAI API key stays on the server
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear client/server boundary
3. **Consistency**: Same pattern as Hero Block AI Test
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add authentication, rate limiting, etc.

## Migration Guide

If you have code using the old `runIndyAction`:

1. Update the function call parameters:
   ```typescript
   // Old
   runIndyAction(message, currentBlock, blockType)
   
   // New
   runIndyAction(message, blockType, { blocks: [currentBlock] })
   ```

2. Handle the new response format:
   ```typescript
   // Old
   if (action.type === 'ADD_BLOCK') { ... }
   
   // New
   if (result.success && result.action) {
     applyIndyAction(result.action, store);
   }
   ```

## Testing

The refactored system was tested with:
- Create operations ✅
- Update operations ✅
- Error handling ✅
- IndyChatPanel integration ✅

## Notes

- No backwards compatibility was maintained (as requested)
- The API server must be running for any Indy operations
- All AI processing happens server-side only
